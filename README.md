Isomorphic React+Express example
================================

Simple example demonstrating how to start building isomorphic Javascript applications.
Used Gulp.js to watch for file changes and run tasks such as minification, tests, precompiling SASS and JSX etc etc 
(take a look at the Gulpfile for more details).

Run "npm install" on the command line first then start the server using the command "node app.js" or "gulp server".

Tools/libs used:
----------------
- Express.js
- React.js
- JSX
- Gulp.js(Task runner)
- Browserify
- Karma + Jasmine(Testing)
- SASS
